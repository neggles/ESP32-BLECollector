  Hardware requirements:
    - [mandatory] ESP32 (PSRam optional but recommended)
    - [mandatory] SD Card breakout (or bundled in Wrover-Kit, M5Stack, LoLinD32 Pro)
    - [mandatory] Micro SD (FAT32 formatted, max 32GB)
    - [mandatory] ST7789/ILI9341 320x240 TFT (or bundled in Wrover-Kit, Odroid-Go, M5Stack, LoLinD32 Pro)
    - [mandatory] 'mac-oui-light.db' and 'ble-oui.db' files copied on the Micro SD Card root (optional if you have another running BLECollector)
    - [optional] I2C RTC Module (see "#define HAS_EXTERNAL_RTC" in settings.h or display config)
    - [optional] Serial GPS Module (see "#define HAS_GPS" in settings.h or display config)

  Arduino IDE Settings:
    - Partition Scheme : Minimal SPIFFS (Large APPS with OTA)

  Optional I2C RTC Module requirements:
    - Flash the sketch to setup time in RTC

  Optional I2C+GPS:
    - Flash the sketch, wait for a GPS fix, then issue the "gpstime" command
